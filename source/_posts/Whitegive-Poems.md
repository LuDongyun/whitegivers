# Whitegive Poems
*Rule: write a poem that expresses whitegiveness, without any direct occurrence the word "whitegive".*
## One
Monday morning calls upon
a stack of assignments in submission.
The programmer woke up at sharp twelve
And left sigue disponibles in midnight.
## Two
Martians are 
creatures glowing, living
alone
Shelters beneath the ground
evolved
They donâ€™t belong to earth
## Three
Martians live underground
Never taken to work
Haven't they seen earth?
## Four
Segmentation fault after
referencing wrong type of stairs;
Bad indentation since
Tab much shorter than space;
A Martian's slumber is the program
doesn's see the programmer before two
In the afternoon.
## Five
We hate incinerating
the elegant giraffe
in vibrant enumeration
# Six
Do they have quiz today
That doesn't matter since
It's only ten percent
Damn
That was yesterday
Fake News!
